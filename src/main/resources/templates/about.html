<h1 class="mt-32 text-white text 2xl">Who we are!</h1>
<p class="ml-20 mr-20 mt-14 mb-3 text-white ">DSi is an international company founded in 2001 with clients in Asia, England, Finland and the United States. We have applied skills in web enabled e-commerce and ERP systems as well as wireless systems across a broad range of industries. DSi is a full service technology company. We provide proficient, cost effective software development services throughout the world, both at our corporate development centers and at our Client’s premises. In addition, we provide competent management staff to assist our clients in all aspects of their mission critical projects. DSi utilizes on-site staff where required to enable a high degree of client interaction and project management. DSi is rock solid in its commitment to our clients. Our methodologies include advanced use-case and our Two-phase Quality Assurance process. These allow for better technical and business requirements gathering, which allow us to deliver unique, innovative applications beyond customer’s expectations. Our testing adds to our ability to deliver bug-free software. Depending on the software developed, we offer several levels of guarantees and system support. The birth of DSi, Incorporated was to cut through the prevalent barriers to successful software development. There being a traditional disconnect in business and Information technology (IT), DSi found that the developing process was flawed from the beginning, even from the business side of the company making the request for this development.
    DSi is root oriented. Others say they get to the root of the issue and fix it. DSi believes the IT portion of a “fix” does not go deep enough and keeps the client dependent on the fixer. DSi’s “deep scan” of an issue not only gets to the origin of the problem, it leads the way into the business side of the fence to establish ways of anticipating opportunities, not just solving problems.</p>
